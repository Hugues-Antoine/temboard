The aim of the *maintenance* plugin is to give the users an overview on the
**databases**, **schemas**, **tables** or **indexes** respective **size**.

It's very useful to get information about **bloat** and **toast**. It can help users
determine potential issues and understand or prevent performance issues due to
unaccordingly used space.

The plugin also provides easy access to maintenance actions such as **VACUUM**,
**ANALYZE** or **REINDEX** in order to fix space or performances problems.


!!! note

    Please beware that the values for bloat, toast, etcâ€¦ are estimated.
    They may not perfectly reflect the reality especially if there hasn't been
    any analyze performed recently.
